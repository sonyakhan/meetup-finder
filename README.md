# Meetup Group Finder

### Overview
Web app which lets the user supply a search query and zipcode to locate nearby Meetup groups! Built using AngularJS 1 and Bootstrap 3, run locally using Node. This project uses the [angular seed application skeleton](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) as a basic starter.

### Prerequisites
Make sure NPM and Bower are both installed. To check, you can run `npm -v` and `bower -v` in the terminal, which should both return version numbers if installed.


### Installation

Install the dependencies and start the server. NPM is configured to automatically run Bower, so you don't have to explicitly run `bower install`. To install and launch the app, in terminal:

```sh
$ cd meetup-app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Then in your browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
